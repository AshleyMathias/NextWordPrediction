# NextWordPrediction
Next Word Prediction Model
Overview
This project implements a Next Word Prediction Model using Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP). The model predicts the most likely next word based on a given sequence of words, making it a fundamental tool in applications like auto-completion, chatbots, and text editors.

Features
Language Modeling: Trains on text data to understand word sequences and context.
Deep Learning-based Prediction: Uses advanced neural network architectures like LSTMs, GRUs, or Transformers.
Customizable Vocabulary: Allows for training with domain-specific datasets.
Real-Time Predictions: Offers instant word suggestions for smooth user experience.
Dataset
Dataset Used: [Dataset Name/Source]
Example: Common Crawl Dataset, Wikipedia Dump, or custom text data.
Preprocessing involves tokenization, cleaning, and splitting into training and testing sets.
Technologies Used
Languages: Python
Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, NLTK, TensorFlow/Keras, PyTorch, Flask
Tools: Jupyter Notebook for analysis and visualization.
Applications
Text Editors: Auto-completion for documents.
Chatbots: Real-time response generation.
Search Engines: Query prediction.
E-Learning Platforms: Sentence building suggestions.
Future Work
Implement Transformer-based models like GPT for improved predictions.
Support multiple languages.
Integrate with a front-end interface for enhanced user experience.
